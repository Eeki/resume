            I am a make-it-happen guy with wide knowledge in web development and
            cloud technologies with a demonstrated history of working with many

            Learning things is what drives me â€” I believe that there is always room
            for improvement, especially with regards to my own abilities,
            and I constantly seek to sharpen my skills.

            In my work I aim for simplicity, maintainability and results.
            Honesty, transparency and failing early
            are my core values that have served me well in my career with customers from
            small and big companies in Finland and abroad.
